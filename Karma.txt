If one gives up all selfish desires and works merely for the sake of duty towards Supreme, 
then such work doesn't create any karmic reactions.

Do your duty but don't concern yourself with the fruits of your results.
Give up the pride of doership even while working.
The fruits of your actions are not for your enjoyment.
Do not be attached to inaction.
